/*
 * Description: Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the inter-
 * secting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth
 * node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second
 * linked list, then they are intersecting.
 *
 * Input: two singly linked lists (at least length of 1)
 * Output: bool
 * Constraints:
 * Edge cases:
 * Ideas: How to check if reference is the same?
