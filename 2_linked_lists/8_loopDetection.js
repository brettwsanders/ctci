/*
 * Description: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm hat returns the node at the beginning of the loop.
 *
 * DEFINITION
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so
 * as to make a loop in the linked list.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
 * Output: C
 *
 * Input: circular linked list (assume its always circular)
 * Output: the node at beginning of the loop
 * Contraints:
 * Edge Cases:
